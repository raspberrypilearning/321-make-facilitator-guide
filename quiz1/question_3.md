A path contains 6 projects. How much time is it expected to take to complete a path? 

--- choices ---

- (x) 6 hours

 --- feedback ---

That's right. Each project in the path should take an hour to complete. There is no rule though, if creators are really enjoying one project and want to take more time that's fine.

- ( ) 1 hour

 --- feedback ---

Not quite, each project should take about an hour to create but there are 6 projects in the path. 

 --- /feedback ---

- () 3 hours

 --- feedback ---

Not quite, there are 3 explore projects in the path which will take a total of around 3 hours to complete, however the path also has 2 design and 1 invent project.

 --- /feedback ---

- ( ) 9 hours

 --- feedback ---

Not quite, the path is a little shorter than this. However, creators can spend a total of 9 hours on a path if they are really enjoying some projects and would like extra time.
