## 2 Design projects  

In design projects, creators are guided through the development process. As they work through the project, they make design decisions based on their own interests. The design projects are an opportunity for creators to practise the skills that they have covered in the first three explore projects. There are no new skills introduced in this type of project. 

### Introduction

The Introduction step gives creators several examples to get inspiration from. They are encouraged to try the example projects and explore their code.
