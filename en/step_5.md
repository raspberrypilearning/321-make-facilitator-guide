## 2 Design projects  

In **design** projects, creators are guided through the development process. They take more responsibility for deciding exactly what to make and which computing concepts to use. The outputs of design projects are much more varied than the output of explore projects. 

At the end of each design project, creators are encouraged to share what they have made with others.

<span style="color: #0faeb0">**Design**</span> means making decisions about the functioning or appearance of a project. It includes software engineering, visual design, usability and accessibility.

### Introduction

The Introduction step gives creators several examples to get inspiration from. They are encouraged to try the example projects and explore their code. 

The examples show creators what they will be able to make by the end of the project. 

**Tip:** If you are limited for time or have creators who need more support then they can start from one of the examples and remix it instead of completely creating their own project. 


## Choose your theme

Design projects usually have a step where learners are encouraged to think about the theme for their project. 

In the Scratch [Surprise Animation](https://projects.raspberrypi.org/en/projects/surprise-animation/) Design project, creators make a surprise animation with four steps. They need to make decision about the sprites and animations that are used. 

They are asked the following questions:
+ Where do you want your animation to take place?
+ Where do you want your sprites to start? How big do you want them to be? How do you want them to look?
+ 

This is an opportunity to:

+ Make the project culturally or locally relevant. You could make an example project to show them have the project can be made with a theme that you know will be relevant to your young creators. 
+ Make the project personally relevant. It is important that young people see that computing and digital making addresses topics that are meaningful to them. Explain that the knowledge they have from their hobbies and interests is really valuable when making computing projects. 

**Tip:** Some young people who are technically very capable struggle to think of their own ideas. They could try and recreate one of the examples without looking at the code. 

## Creation steps 

The main steps in a Design project guide creators throught the stages of making the project. Design projects include tasks that require learners 

The project model the decomposition of a project into manageable steps. At the end of each step, creators will have a part or feature of their project working. 




### Research and Software Engineering links

+ Offering **choice** increases engagement by making projects more relevant and meaningful to young people. 
+ Each design project comes with four **worked examples** that creators can review to understand how the projects were made. 
+ Starter projects and guided instructions provide a **plan** which helps to break a project done into achievable parts.
+ Allowing creators to become familiar with concepts and skills in Explore projects before asking them to apply those skills creatively manages the **cognitive load** that they experience on the path to becoming independent makers. 
+ Use-Modify-Create and PRIMM advocate gradually transferring ownership of code from the educator to the learner.
+ **Debugging** is often reported as a difficult area for beginners. We are able to give context-specific **Debug:** steps in Design projects.
+ The structured guidance for making personally relevant projects increases chances of success and the development of **self-efficacy**.
+ Professional software developers often use **design patterns** to capture best practices in an area of computing.  
+ Giving creators access to best practice code snippets helps to avoid the **Turing tarpit** where beginners are given environments where they could do anything but it's hard to do cool stuff. 
+ Software developers progress from writing code that has been designed by others to taking more responsibility for design.
