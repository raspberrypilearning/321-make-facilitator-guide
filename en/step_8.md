## Make! projects 

As a result of working through a path, learners are empowered to develop their own ideas and create solutions to situations they or their communities face, with increased independence. 

Creators can use the skills they've gained, along with reference materials, to create something totally new and unique.

### Make! another invent project

The invent projects have been designed to be flexible when it comes to the context and the skills that creators want to showcase. If your creator needs some scafolding to come up with their own project idea then you can encourage them to make another invent project for a different context or theme. 

### Timescale

Independent making can be carried out over various time periods depending on your constraints. You could run a single session or allocate several weeks to team based projects.  

### Encourage team work

+ Pair programming
+ Team work
