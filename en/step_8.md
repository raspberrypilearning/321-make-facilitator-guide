## Make! projects 

As a result of working through a path, learners are empowered to develop their own ideas and create solutions to situations they or their communities face, with increased independence. 

Creators can use the skills they've gained, along with reference materials, to create something totally new and unique.

### Make! another invent project

The Invent projects have been designed to be flexible when it comes to the context and the skills that creators want to showcase. If your creator needs some scafolding to come up with their own project idea then you can encourage them to make another Invent project for a different context or theme. 

### Timescale

Independent making can be carried out over various time periods depending on your constraints. You could run a single session or allocate several weeks to team based projects.  

### Encourage collaboration

+ Pair programming

A pair programming approach can support creators to develop programs and problem solve more successfully. Application of this approach is more than simply asking two creators to work together and involves them taking on two different roles: driver and navigator.

A [quick read](https://blog.teachcomputing.org/quick-read-pair-programming-supports-learners/){:target="_blank"} is available if you would like more information on pair programming. 

+ Team work

Every creator is an individual who will have different interests and skills. Some might really enjoy creating artwork for characters and backdrops, others might prefer to spend time on perfecting the accuracy of providing scores for a game. Having a wide range of skills in a group can be a real asset to a project. 

When working on Make! projects, encourage your creators to work in teams with people that have different skillsets to them. They can then assign roles and learn how to work together to produce something really cool.

### Use the guides

The technology-specific guides provide reference materials. The recently developed guides feature the same info cards that creators will be familiar with from Design and Invent projects.

### When creators are ready to move on

Creators will often decide for themselves when they wish to move on to some new skills. This might be at the end of the Invent project or it could be after creating several Make! projects.
