## Make! projects 

After finishing a path, creators can use the skills they've developed, along with reference materials, to create something totally new and unique.

Then when they are ready, they can start a new path. 

As a result of working through a path, learners are empowered to make their own ideas and create solutions to situations they or their communities face, with increased independence.
