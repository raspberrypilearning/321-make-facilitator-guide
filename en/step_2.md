## Why 321 Make! ?

While designing the new format for our projects, we found that, as well as support and opportunities to practise while acquiring new skills and knowledge, creators need a learning journey that lets them gradually develop and demonstrate increasing independence. 

Independence includes creativity and deciding what to make as well as designing and building projects.

+ Independence (I can make things that matter to me)
+ Computing identity (I am a maker)
+ Lifelong learning (I can find things out that I need to know)
+ Relevance (I believe that computing and digital making is important to me)
+ Inclusion (I belong to a maker community)

[Times have changed, some children now have formal computing education. Computing education research has developed. The need for young people to develop a lifelong interest in digital making is more important than ever.]


Each path is made up of six projects, and the projects become less structured as creators progress. This allows learners to practise their newly acquired skills and use their creativity and interests to make projects that **matter to them**. In this way, creators develop more and more independence, and when they reach the final project in the path, they are presented with a project brief.
