## 3 Explore projects 

**Explore** projects are step-by-step instructions that introduce creators to a set of skills and help them develop initial confidence. Each path begins with 3 Explore projects that between them contain the set of skills and concepts needed for the entire path.

We recommend that facilitators complete the projects themselves before running a session with creators. This familiarity with the project helps aniticpate issues and you can make note of discussion points - you may wish to share your version of the project with the group for extra inspiration at the end of the session.  

### Tasks 

Creators work through the project tasks, each task has a green background and a grey checkmark box in the top-right corner. Once a creator has completed the task they can check the box, this turns the checkmark into a green filled box and fades the content. 

--- task ---
 
Click on the checkmark box for this task to see what happens. 

Using the checkmark helps creators follow which tasks they have completed. It also helps facilitators when helping the creators to debug their projects. 

--- /task ---

Thare are several types of task including: 
+ **Choose:** - creators are encouraged to add personalisation to their projects. We view choice as important even in step-by-step explore projects and offer choice throughout projects.  
+ **Test:** - creators run their project to see the outcome. Creators are encouraged to test regularly as they develop their project a bit at a time.
+ **Save:** - a reminder to save their projects where applicable. These tasks include guidance on how to save as well as acting as a reminder to save.
+ **Debug:** - containing hints, tips, and instructions to help creators solve common problems they find. Creators are also encouraged to celebrate bugs not listed by sharing them via the 'Send feedback' button 

### Try it Tasks

The Introduction step in Explore projects has a **Try it** task to be used at the beginning of your session. This sets the scene for your creators by encouraging them to play with the finished example of the project they will be creating. 

Investigation questions encourage them to interact with the project. This task can be completed indpendently by the creators or together as an introduction to your session. 

Here is an example of a **Try it** task from our [Space talk](https://projects.raspberrypi.org/en/projects/space-talk){:target="_blank"} project that requires user interaction:

### Try it
<div style="display: flex; flex-wrap: wrap">
<div style="flex-basis: 175px; flex-grow: 1">  
Click on each sprite to see what they do. 

What happens if you click on one sprite and then quickly click on another sprite?

### Step introductions

The projects are split into pages (steps), each step begins with a description and images showing creators what they will have made by the end of the step. 

This is the step introduction from the 'Exhaust effects' step in our [Rocket launch](https://projects.raspberrypi.org/en/projects/rocket-launch){:target="_blank"} project: 

--- task ---

<div style="display: flex; flex-wrap: wrap">
<div style="flex-basis: 200px; flex-grow: 1; margin-right: 15px;">

The rocket will look more realistic with some special effects to simulate the exhaust trail. 

You can create cool effects by using a `for` loop to draw lots of shapes in each frame.

### Project boxouts

Project boxouts are used to highlight talking points and extra information such as industry links, role models, and interesting facts. Boxouts can be used as a group discussion point or read independently by creators.

--- task ---

Here is an example of a boxout from our [Catch the bus](https://projects.raspberrypi.org/en/projects/catch-the-bus){:target="_blank"} project where an animation is made: 

Would you use boxouts independently or as a group?

<p style="border-left: solid; border-width:10px; border-color: #0faeb0; background-color: aliceblue; padding: 10px;">
<span style="color: #0faeb0">**Animation**</span> creates the effect of movement by changing pictures quickly. The first animators carved pictures out of wooden blocks and used them as stamps. It is much faster to use Scratch to code your animation!

### Info cards

Info cards in explore projects are used to give extra information. They could add more detail about a skill, provide an alternative choice, or help debug a common problem. 

--- task ---

Click on the Info card below to expand it. 

In this example from our [Grow a dragonfly](https://projects.raspberrypi.org/en/projects/grow--dragonfly){:target="_blank"} project the Info card is a guide explaining how to use the Scratch backpack feature and will only be expanded by those creators that want to know how to use it:

### Upgrade your project step

Each explore project contains an **upgrade your project** step with ideas and aspirational projects for creators to develop their project further with the skills they have already. 

Upgrade steps are open ended so are great for a session where creators are working at different paces. They're also a chance to build localisation and personalise projects. 

At the end of a session you could have 'show and tell' where creators share their projects and talk about their creation process. This would be a good time to look at the upgrade options to celebrate how far their new skills can take them.   

The upgrade step also contains an Info card with link to the completed solution. 

--- task ---

Here is an example of an upgrade step from our Beating heart [Beating heart](https://projects.raspberrypi.org/en/projects/beating-heart){:target="_blank"} project.

<div style="display: flex; flex-wrap: wrap">
<div style="flex-basis: 200px; flex-grow: 1; margin-right: 15px;">
If you have time, you can upgrade your beating heart project. 

You can use your portable beating heart as a room decoration. Set it to a slow speed to help you relax. Or, adjust the beat to match the music you are listening to. 
</div>
<div>
![Animated gif showing a papercraft heart with a red and a blue LED pulsing in time to the heartbeat.](images/two-beats.gif){:width="300px"}
</div>
</div>

You could:
+ Create a better papercraft heart. 
+ Add a blue LED to represent de-oxygenated blood entering and leaving the heart. 
+ Add a heartbeat sound using a passive buzzer.
+ Add more LEDs and papercraft hearts and make them pulse at the same time. Choose any colour LED you like.
--- /task ---

### What next step

Explore projects end with a **what next** step that has links to the path overview and the next project in the path. 

You could end your session by looking at this step as a group and building excitment for the next project. 

--- task ---

Below is an example from our [Broadcasting spells](https://projects.raspberrypi.org/en/projects/broadcasting-spells){:target="_blank"} project. How would you use it to motivate creators for next session? 

If you are following the [More Scratch](https://projects.raspberrypi.org/en/raspberrypi/more-scratch) path, you can move on to the [Grow a dragonfly](https://projects.raspberrypi.org/en/projects/grow-a-dragonfly) project. In this project, you will make a Dragonfly that eats insects.

### Research and software engineering

+ Explore projects begin with a **Try it:** step which is similar to the **Use** step in Use-Modify-Create. It is important that creators understand what a project is supposed to do. This provides context for the instructions that they follow. Each step also shows what they will achieve by the end of the step so that they have a clear understanding of the expected outcome. 
+ Beginning with **direct instruction** introduces new concepts in a structured way to ensure that creators are familiar with the skills that they will need to apply later on. 
+ **Step by step instructions** build early success and give creators the chance to gain familiarity with tools.
+ Explore projects **model** the best practices of building a project up step by step with regular testing and debugging. Professional software developers often learn new skills from more experienced colleagues. 
+ Small **choices** are built into the projects allow creators to feel more connected with their projects without making over-ambitious changes that can lead to frustration. 
+ Multiple choice questions at the end of the main project steps provide an opportunity to review and embed knowledge and is a form of **assessment for learning**. They also provide the opportunity to **celebrate** and **reflect** on what has been achieved.
+ Early success leads to an increase in **self-efficacy** which in know to be a factor in increasing future participation in computing.
