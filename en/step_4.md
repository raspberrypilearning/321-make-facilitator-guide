## 3 Explore projects 

Explore projects are step-by-step instructions that introduce creators to a set of skills and help them develop initial confidence. Each path begins with 3 Explore projects that between them contain the set of skills and concepts needed for the entire path.

We recommend that facilitators complete the projects themselves before running a session with creators. This familiarity with the project helps aniticpate issues and make note of discussion points - you may wish to share your version of the project with the group for extra inspiration at the end of the session.  

### Using Tasks 

Creators work through the project tasks, each task has a green background and a grey checkmark box in the top-right corner. Once a creator has completed the task they can check the box, this turns the checkmark into a green filled box and fades the content. 

--- task ---
 
Click on the checkmark box for this task to see what happens. 

Using the checkmark helps creators follow which tasks they have completed. It also helps facilitators when helping the creators to debug their projects.

### Try it Tasks

The Introduction step in Explore projects has a **Try it** task to be used at the beginning of your session. This sets the scene for your creators by encouraging them to play with the finished example of the project they will be creating. 

Investigation questions encourage them to interact with the project. This task can be completed indpendently by the creators or together as an introduction to your session. 

Here is an example of a **Try it** task from a project that requires user interaction:

### Try it
<div style="display: flex; flex-wrap: wrap">
<div style="flex-basis: 175px; flex-grow: 1">  
Click on each sprite to see what they do. 

What happens if you click on one sprite and then quickly click on another sprite?

### Project boxouts

Project boxouts are used to highlight talking points and extra information such as industry links, role models, and interesting facts. Boxouts can be used as a group discussion point or read independently by creators.

Here is an example of a boxout that appears on a project where an animation is made:  

<p style="border-left: solid; border-width:10px; border-color: #0faeb0; background-color: aliceblue; padding: 10px;">
<span style="color: #0faeb0">**Animation**</span> creates the effect of movement by changing pictures quickly. The first animators carved pictures out of wooden blocks and used them as stamps. It is much faster to use Scratch to code your animation!
