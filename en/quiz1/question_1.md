## Reflection

This is an example of a reflection quiz that you would find in an explore project. It is a chance to celebrate new skills and creations. 

Reflection comes at the end of the main project making steps but before any upgrades. Reflecting is an important part of learning, because it helps make new connections in your brain.

Creators answer three questions to reflect on what they've learned.

After each question, they press 'Check my answer'. If an answer is incorrect, useful feedback will be guide them towards the correct answer. There is no limit to the amount of times they can attempt each question.

Try this quiz out for yourself. Have fun!
