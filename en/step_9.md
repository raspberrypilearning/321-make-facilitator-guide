### Make connections

If learners are interested in what they are making then they'll be more motivated. They'll also be clearer on what they want the project to do. Make it clear that their experiences are valuable. Ask them about what is important to them and encourage them to use that in their projects. 

### Develop independence

Don't be too quick to rescue learners when there's a problem - show them how to problem solve and debug. Encourage the 'rubber duck' technique: explain the problem to a toy or other object and you might just spot the problem.

### Embrace bugs

Embrace bugs and mistakes as a normal part of the process. Explain that you learn more when something goes wrong and you have to fix it. You might also have a 'happy accident' where you like an unintentional result. 

### Showcase projects

Encourage sharing. Highlight opportunities to share work. It can be really rewarding to know that your work has users. This doesn't have to be their final product, it could be what they learned today.

### Celebrate as you go

Celebrate the behaviours you want to reward: debugging a problem, helping a friend, explaining what your code does. 

### Empower the makers of the future

Help learners understand how they can use computing to make a difference to themselves and the world around them from addressing climate change to creating a relaxing animation.
