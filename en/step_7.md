## 1 Invent project

In **invent** projects, creators focus on completing a project to meet a **project brief** for a particular audience. The project brief is written so that they can meet it using the **skills** theyâ€™ve learned by following the path up to this point. Creators are provided with reference material, but are free to decide which skills to use. They need to plan their project and decide on the order to carry out tasks.

Invent projects have much in common with Sushi cards from CoderDojo as well as specific challenges and missions from the Raspberry Pi Foundation and Code Club. 

### Introduction

The introduction gives creators **one** initial project to explore with some guided questions for them to think about. They are then introduced to the project brief which provides guidance on what the creators should be working towards. 

Here is the project brief that is given to creators in our [Sensory gadget](https://projects.raspberrypi.org/en/projects/sensory-gadget){:target="_blank"} Invent project from the 'Introduction to the Rasberry Pi Pico' path:

<div style="border-top: 15px solid #f3524f; background-color: whitesmoke; margin-bottom: 20px; padding: 10px;">

### PROJECT BRIEF: Sensory gadget
<hr style="border-top: 2px solid black;">

Brief explanation of the aims of the project. 

Your sensory gadget should:
+ Have multiple different kinds of input
+ Have multiple different outputs
+ Be appealing to the user and robust enough to be used

Your sensory gadget could:
+ Take ergonomics like user comfort into consideration
+ Reset on user input or after a set amount of time 
+ Connect to a specific theme

</div>

Creators are then given **at least three** more examples of invent project examples that provide a wide range of ideas to support them with their own designs. They are encouraged to explore them and look at the code to see how other creators have approached the same brief in different ways. 

### Your idea

Most invent projects have a **Your idea** step where the creators think about the purpose and audience for their projects. They also begin to make the design decisions for their projects. 

Here is an example question that is asked in our [I made you a book](https://projects.raspberrypi.org/en/projects/i-made-you-a-book){:target="_blank"} Invent project from the 'Introduction to Scratch' path:

--- task --- 

Think about the purpose of your book.

It could be:

To entertain a younger child
To share an important message, such as encouraging recycling
To teach someone how to do something, such as how to make your favourite food
To tell or retell a story
To share something about yourself
To express yourself and be creative

Think about who you will make your book for (your audience).

It could be for a friend, for a family member, for a school class, for people who share a hobby, for fans of a musician, or just for yourself.

--- /task ---

The **Your idea** step also includes any starter files that creators might need to get started with their projects. This often includes helpful code, images and files to make it easier for them to get going with their ideas.

### Build and test

The **Build and test** stage can sometimes go over two steps, depending on the length of the project. This stage gives creators **info cards** for every single skill that is covered in the earlier projects. The cards are catagorised to aid creators in finding the ones that they need for the part of the problem they are trying to solve. 

Here is an example from our [Powerful patterns](https://projects.raspberrypi.org/en/projects/powerful-patterns){:target="_blank"} Invent project from the 'Introduction to Python' path:

--- task ---

You have built up some really useful skills. Here is a reminder to help you make your motif:

### Shapes and images

[[[processing-python-ellipse]]]

[[[processing-python-rect]]]

[[[processing-python-triangle]]]

[[[processing-add-image]]]

### Colours and effects

[[[generic-theory-simple-colours]]]

[[[processing-opacity]]]

[[[processing-stroke]]]

[[[processing-tint]]]

### Position and transform

[[[processing-matrix]]]

[[[processing-translation]]]

[[[processing-rotation]]]

[[[python-operators]]]

[[[generic-python-for-loop-repeat]]]

--- /task ---

### Reflection

The reflection step for **invent** projects is a time for your creators to think about the skills that they have used and to check if they have met the project brief. 

They should go through each one and use the check list provided to 'check off' what they have done. 

After completing this step, creators are awarded with their project badge. This example from our [This sprite needs you](https://projects.raspberrypi.org/en/projects/this-sprite-needs-you){:target="_blank"} Invent project encourages celebration as the creators reflect:

**Now you are the creator of a simulation!**

Take a moment to celebrate what you have made.

<p style="border-left: solid; border-width:10px; border-color: #0faeb0; background-color: aliceblue; padding: 10px;">
<span style="color: #0faeb0">Computer simulations</span> can allow us to experience situations that we couldn't in real life. There are computer simulations that allow surgeons to practice operations. There are simulations that allow space engineers to predict what will happen when they launch a rocket, and make changes to the variables to see what happens. And there are game simulations that allow you to take care of a pet, person, family, or job.

### Upgrade 

If your creators have time and they want to take their project further then they are encouraged to do this in the upgrade step. They can revisit the projects on the introduction page to get more inspiration for expanding on what they have achieved. 

### Share 

The Raspberry Pi foundation has a strong community of digital makers. It is really important to ask your creators to share their projects in the showcase with us. This allows other makers in the community to see their ideas and gain inspiration from their peers. 

In this step, creators will be guided through sharing their project. This could also include in-person sharing. 

Creators will have the opportunity to share their project with the Raspberry Pi Foundation community by submitting to a Studio or Gallery.

+ **Design thinking** is a human-centered approach to going from an identified need to a working solution. It includes empathising with potential users and creating prototypes and reacting to feedback.
+ In industry developers often have to work to a **project brief**.
+ A **project brief** provides clear guidance on what is expected and acts as a **rubric**. 
+ **Info cards** provide easy access to reference materials. Being able to work with reference materials is an important skill for software developers. 
+ As with Design projects, the examples act as **worked examples**. 
+ Creating projects that are personally relevant increases engagement and helps young people to develop their [**computing identity**](https://www.raspberrypi.org/blog/digital-divide-socioeconomic-disadvantage-computing-education/){:target="_blank"}. 
+ A focus on **sharing** projects and getting **feedback** is an important aspect of **constructionism**. 
+ The **reflection** step in Invent projects encourages creators to reflect on their successes and difficulties. Reflection is known to make an important contribution to learning. 
+ Invent projects provide an opportunity for [**culturally relevant pedagogy**](https://blog.teachcomputing.org/quick-read-culturally-relevant-pedagogy/){:target="_blank"} which values the knowledge and experiences that creators bring to their projects. 
+ Invent projects draw on the ideas of [**project-based learning**](https://blog.teachcomputing.org/project-based-learning/){:target="_blank"}.
