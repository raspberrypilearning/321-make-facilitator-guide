## 1 Invent project

In **invent** projects, creators focus on completing a project to meet a **project brief** for a particular audience. The project brief is written so that they can meet it using the **skills** theyâ€™ve learned by following the path up to this point. Creators are provided with reference material, but are free to decide which skills to use. They need to plan their project and decide on the order to carry out tasks.

### Introduction

The introduction gives creators **one** initial project to explore with some guided questions for them to think about. They are then introduced to the project brief which provides guidance on what the creators should be working towards. 

Here is the project brief that is given to creators in the 'Introduction to the Rasberry Pi Pico' path:

<div style="border-top: 15px solid #f3524f; background-color: whitesmoke; margin-bottom: 20px; padding: 10px;">

### PROJECT BRIEF: Sensory gadget
<hr style="border-top: 2px solid black;">

Brief explanation of the aims of the project. 

Your sensory gadget should:
+ Have multiple different kinds of input
+ Have multiple different outputs
+ Be appealing to the user and robust enough to be used

Your sensory gadget could:
+ Take ergonomics like user comfort into consideration
+ Reset on user input or after a set amount of time 
+ Connect to a specific theme

</div>

Creators are then given **at least three** more examples of invent projects that provide a wide range of ideas to support them with their own designs. They are encouraged to explore them and look at the code to see how other creators have approached the same brief in different ways. 

### Your idea

Most invent projects have a **Your idea** step where the creators think about the purpose and audience for their projects. They also begin to make the design decisions for their projects. 

Here is an example question that is asked in the 'Introduction to the Raspberry Pi Pico' path:

--- task ---

Think about the purpose of your sensory gadget. 

It could be:
+ For a younger sibling to learn about sights and sounds
+ A way of relieving tension through pressing buttons and hearing sounds
+ A communication tool to help people express their needs 

--- /task ---

The **Your idea** step also includes any starter files that creators might need to get started with their projects. This often includes helpful code, images and files to make it easier for them to get going with their ideas.

### Build and test

The **Build and test** stage can sometimes go over two steps, depending on the length of the project. This stage gives creators **info cards** for every single skill that is covered in the earlier projects. The cards are catagorised to aid creators in finding the ones that they need for the part of the problem they are trying to solve. 

The '[Introduction to the Raspberry Pi Pico](https://projects.raspberrypi.org/en/projects/sensory-gadget/2){:target="_blank"}' path lists over 50 info cards to support your creators with their projects. 

### Reflection

The [reflection](https://projects.raspberrypi.org/en/projects/sensory-gadget/3){:target="_blank"} step for **invent** projects is a time for your creators to think about the skills that they have used and to check if they have met the project brief. 

They should go through each one and use the check list provided to 'check off' what they have done. After completing this step, creators are awarded with their project badge. 

### Upgrade 

If your creators have time and they want to take their project further then they are encouraged to do this in the upgrade step. They can revisit the projects on the introduction page to get more inspiration for expanding on what they have achieved. 

### Share 

The Raspberry Pi foundation has a strong community of digital makers. It is really important to ask your creators to share their projects in the showcase with us. This allows other makers in the community to see their ideas and gain inspiration from their peers. 

In this step, creators will be guided through sharing their project. This could also include in-person sharing. 

Creators will have the opportunity to share their project with the Raspberry Pi Foundation community by submitting to a Studio or Gallery. 

## Research and software engineering

+ **Design thinking** is a human-centered approach to going from an identified need to a working solution. It includes empathising with potential users and creating prototypes and reacting to feedback.
+ In industry developers often have to work to a **project brief**.
+ A **project brief** provides clear guidance on what is expected and acts as a **rubric**. 
+ **Info cards** provide easy access to reference materials. Being able to work with reference materials is an important skill for software developers. 
+ As with Design projects, the examples act as **worked examples**. 
+ Creating projects that are personally relevant increases engagement and helps young people to develop their **computing identity**. 
+ A focus on **sharing** projects and getting **feedback** is an important aspect of **constructionism**. 
+ The **reflection** step in Invent projects encourages creators to reflect on their successes and difficulties. Reflection is known to make an important contribution to learning.
